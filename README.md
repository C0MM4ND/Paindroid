# Paindroid

Paindroid(Pain + droid) is a Personalised Mobile Pain Diary on Android Platform.

This is the Assignment 3 (Android App Development) (30%) in FIT5046 Mobile and distributed computing systems - S1 2021.

## Intro(Requirements?)

The Android practical assignment aims towards building a mobile and distributed, personalised pain diary application that enables individuals to record their pain experience and related factors such as their pain intensity level, pain location, physical activities (or number of steps taken daily) and mood.

It allows users to view daily, weekly and monthly reports and monitor their health and progress. These reports can help the individual as well as their doctor to better understand their condition and the relationships between the environmental variables such as their pain intensity and weather. 

The mobile app will interact with the public web APIs (e.g. weather public APIs) to retrieve relevant and useful information. The assignment MUST be implemented in Android Studio 11.

## Run Me

I have already deactivated all api keys so the app won't run as normal if directly running.

**MUST change** the firebase(google cloud) and openweathermap **api keys to yours** and build it.

## Final Mark

Some future enhancements (according to tutor suggestions) for comers:

- Alarm manager & work manager are hard to display on interview. Remember to get ready for this (by changing the conditions). I have written them but got no grade due to not ready when interviewing.
- Insert enough data for line chart before the interview.
- Mood level emoji is not recognized as images required.
